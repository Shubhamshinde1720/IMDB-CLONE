Coding Ninjas frontend skill test-2


Hey there! So, imagine you're on the internet, and you want to find information about movies easily. Well, this project is like a magic tool for that! It uses a cool thing called vanilla JavaScript to make everything smooth and easy for you.

The best part? You can search for movies! You type in the name, and the project talks to something called an API (it's like a movie information database) to get all sorts of details about the movie you're curious about. It tells you things like the movie's name, when it came out, and other important stuff.

And get this â€“ it doesn't just throw a bunch of information at you. Nope! It organizes everything in a way that's super simple to read. You'll find what you're looking for in no time!

But wait, there's more! You can even pick your favorite movies. There's this cute button on the left side of each movie. Just click it, and boom, that movie is marked as your favorite. Why? So next time, you can easily find your special movies without searching all over again.

In a nutshell, this project is like your movie buddy on the web. It shows off how good someone is at using cool internet tools (like APIs) and making things work smoothly using JavaScript. It's like a little adventure in web development, making your movie searches and favorite picks a breeze!
